# Css-Animated-Card
This is an animated basketball card coded entirely in pure CSS and HTML. The card is dynamic, and when you hover over the card, the player (in this case, Steph Curry) pops out. There are shadows and depth to the image, and it is a very high quality, smooth animation. You have to see it for yourself, I can't really describe its coolness.
